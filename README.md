cp .env.example .env.local
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Contribution

For instructions on local development, deployment, configurations & feature proposals, see [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## IPFS deployment

Each commit gets deployed to IPFS automatically

There's a github action commenting the appropriate IPFS hash embedded in the Cloudflare IPFS gateway after each commit

For ease of use:

- the DNS of [https://staging.sparkprotocol.io](https://staging.sparkprotocol.io) will always point to the latest main IPFS hash with all networks enabled
- the DNS of [https://app.sparkprotocol.io](https://app.sparkprotocol.io) will always point to the latest main IPFS hash with disabled test networks

### Troubleshooting

Issue: I cannot connect to `app.sparkprotocol.io`

The spark-interface is hosted on IPFS in a decentralized manner. `app.sparkprotocol.io` just holds a CNAME record to the Cloudflare IPFS gateway. You can use [any](https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/) public or private IPFS gateway supporting origin isolation to access spark-interface if for some reason the Cloudflare gateway doesn't work for you

Just go to `<your favorite public ipfs gateway>/ipns/app.sparkprotocol.io`

⚠️ Make sure the gateway supports origin isolation to avoid possible security issues: you should be redirected to URL that looks like `https://app-sparkprotocol-io.<your gateway>`
